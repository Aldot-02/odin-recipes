        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped nuts (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if desired) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may appear slightly undercooked, but they will firm up as they cool.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies!</li>
